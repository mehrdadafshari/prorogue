				<h1>Prorogued Programming</h1>

				<p><em>Prorogued programming</em> is a new paradigm closely aligned with the programmer&apos;s thought process by providing
				the ability to <strong>prorogue</strong>, to defer a concern, to focus on and finish the current concern, run and experiment
				with an incomplete program, and gradually and iteratively reify the missing parts while catching design and implementation
				mistakes early.</p>

				To learn more about prorogued programming,
				<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Prorogued-Programming">SPLASH Onward! 2012 presentation</a> and read our paper,
					<a href="paper.pdf" alt="Liberating the Programmer with Prorogued Programming">
						Liberating the Programmer with Prorogued Programming</a>, and stay tuned! We'll update
					this page shortly, with links to our prototype implementation of a prorogued programming language,
					Prorogued C#, including source code. Please hang tight and spread the word! We believe prorogued
					programming has the potential to change the way people program, but we need your help to get there!

				<h3>What's next?</h3>
				<p>
				We love to see prorogued programming realized in other languages, most notably, JavaScript! If you have taken time
				to realize prorogued programming in your favorite language, share it with us. Let us know if you need help in
				seamless adaptation of this paradigm in the language you're working in.
